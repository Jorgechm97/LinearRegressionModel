# Predicting Student Grades using Machine Learning

## Project description

This project implements a supervised linear regression machine learning model to predict students' final grades based on various variables such as age, gender, study time, absences, and previous grades. Predicting final grades is crucial to identify possible areas of improvement in students' academic performance and provide personalized support.

##Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) and contains data related to student performance in different academic aspects .

## Requirements

-Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

## Results

The trained supervised linear regression model has demonstrated an accuracy of 85.08% in predicting students' final grades. Furthermore, the Mean Square Error (MSE) obtained was 1.97, which shows the level of precision and performance of the model.

## Additional Information

- Visualizations of the correlation between key variables and students' final grades are included for a better understanding of the results.
- You can customize and adjust the parameters of the linear regression model in the main code to further improve the accuracy of the predictions.
